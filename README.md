## Boston Fire Incident Prediction
This project explores the use of machine learning to predict the type of emergency response needed based on historical fire department data. Using public datasets from the Boston Fire Department and the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), we built and evaluated models that forecast the likelihood and nature of a fire-related incident. To vislaize this data, we built a CesiumJS-powered 3D viewer to visualize Bostonâ€™s built environment and overlay predicted fire risks.


## Project Overview
Over 600,000 fire department incident records were cleaned, merged, and used to train predictive models. Our goal was to predict the type of emergency (e.g., fire, false alarm, service call) and visualize predicted risks on a 3D map of Boston
  
## Objectives
- Improve public safety insights using machine learning
- Predict the likely category of an emergency incident before dispatch
- Handle severe class imbalance using reclassification and resampling
- Integrate model output into a geospatial viewer for interpretation

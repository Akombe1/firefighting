# The Future of Fire: Predicting and Visualizing Boston Fire Incidents

## Overview

The Future of Fire is a machine learning and geospatial analysis project that explores historical fire incident data from Boston (2012â€“2024) to predict and visualize emergency response patterns.

Using over 600,000 incident records, we built two predictive models. One to determine whether an emergency call is a fire and another to classify the type of incident. Our results are showcased through a custom-built React website with interactive Mapbox maps, charts, and model evaluation summaries.

##  Project Goals

- Use historical fire department data to model and predict:
  - Whether a reported emergency is a fire
  - The most likely emergency category (e.g., EMS, false alarm, fire)
- Address severe class imbalance with SMOTE
- Identify key time/location/property features contributing to fire risk
- Visualize patterns through exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Present results interactively using Mapbox 3D maps, clustering, and timeline animations

## Methods

### Binary Classifier: Is it a Fire?
- Model: `RandomForestClassifier` with `class_weight='balanced'`
- Features: Time (hour, month), location (zip, district), property type
- Accuracy: ~85%
- Key features: Hour of day, day of week, and property use code

### ðŸ”¹ Multiclass Classifier: What Type of Incident?
- Model: Random Forest + SMOTE
- Accuracy: ~40%
- Handles 8 classes including fire, EMS, service calls, and false alarms
- Key challenge: extreme class imbalance


## Visualizations

- EDA Dashboard: Temporal patterns, top incident types, geographic hot zones
- Mapbox Heatmap: Displays all confirmed fires over 12 years using KMeans clustering
- 3D Animated Map: Year-by-year timeline of fire events in Boston, rendered with Mapbox GL JS
- Model Plots: Confusion matrices and top feature importances for both models

## How to Run

### 1. Backend Scripts (Python)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn

cd Fire_Data
python3 1.merging.py                  # Merge & clean data - download data from google drive link - too large to push on github
python3 3.trainFire.py                # Train binary fire model
python3 4.trainCategories.py          # Train category model
python3 5.fireModelPlots.py           # Save model plots
python3 6.trainFire_SMOTE.py          # Optional: train with SMOTE
python3 7.trainCategory_SMOTE.py
python3 8.categoryModelPlots.py
```

### 2. React Frontend

```
cd fire-visualization
npm install
npm start
```
